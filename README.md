# NetworkingConcepts
This project is a Networks and Communication Learning Showcase built using React and Vite. It demonstrates my understanding of key networking concepts learned during my first month in a Networks and Communication course. The website features sections on Networking Concepts, Additional Resources, and a Reflection on my learning journey.
